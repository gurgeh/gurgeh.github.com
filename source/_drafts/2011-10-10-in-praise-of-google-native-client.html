In 2008 some smart guys released a paper on how you can allow native code to run sandboxed on the x86 architecture. It was not quite a formal proof, but close enough for most of us. This means that you can trust programs to run with full speed on your desktop, without the security risks usually associated with running untrusted code natively.<br /><br />This research spawned Google Native Client (or NaCl for short), which is a technology for running native code in your browser. Yes, this means that when you need that extra performance, you have the possibility of real honest-to-god compiled code in your webapp. NaCl has been humming along without much visible progress for a while, but a few days ago they released a sneak peak at the SDK together with a compatible version of Chromium.<br /><br />Many developers were happy about the prospects of native web apps, but many also questioned what the point of moving yet another thing into the browser is. I am firmly on the optimistic side and I would like to explain why I think this is important for the future web.<br /><br />A biased and unfair conversation between myself and a straw man without the wherewithal to defend himself<br /><br /><i>Straw Man:</i><br />NaCl is the suckiest suck that ever sucked, the web should be platform independent.<br /><br /><i>Me:</i><br />Yes, it should. NaCl targets x86 in this preview, but on release it will at least target x86-32, x86-64 and ARM. That includes just about any desktop, notebook and netbook in the foreseeable future and most of the brawnier smartphones. Also, see below.<br /><br /><i>Straw Man:</i><br />Below? I thought this was a conversation? Nevermind.<br />I saw that the SDK was just a GCC compiler. Mang, C sucks. If you really want performance, it will be increasingly important to use all cores in parallell. Who has the patience to write correct multi threaded C code?<br /><br />Me:<br />Well, you will be happy to hear that they are moving to LLVM, so not only will you be able to target more platforms, but<br />NaCl modules don't need to be written in C/C++. In fact, you can write NaCl modules in Go, in Python and Lua using ports that contributors have submitted, and you can even write hand-coded assembly in Native Client if you so desire!</div>
