I have switched from Blogspot to [Octopress](http://octopress.org). Any self respecting coder should realize that 1) blogging is text and 2) text should be in revision control. Also 3) blogging is public text, so the revision control can be on a public server, like Github.

It was fairly easy, just follow the instructions on Octopress. If you are running Ubuntu, don't apt-get rbenv, use the latest version from Github instead (which is what the Octopress instructions assumes).

The Octopress instructions for deploying to Github is also straightforward enough, as are the Github instructions for using your own domain name.

I used an [external script](https://gist.github.com/1765496) to migrate my Blogspot articles to my new site. It worked OK, but formatting was lost and the comments became static text.

There are not an abundance of themes yet, but you can always design one yourself. Picking colors and doing basic layout is easy. If you are design impaired, like I, there are a few ready-made [here](https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-Party-Octopress-Themes).

That's basically it. Hopefully this means I blog more. And better. And that the next post contains code.
