    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
Having given the topic of artificial general intelligence (or AGI) a fair amount of thought over the last decade, a plausible path forward, based on something like an encyclopedia for algorithms, has slowly congealed in my head. I need to write it down before I start coding. Preferably in the form of a blog post, to get feedback. This is that post.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Background</span><br /><br />When I write about strong AI or AGI, I mean an algorithm with general problem solving skills. Not necessarily a mind inhabiting a robot, running around talking to people and passing the Turing test (though eventually a successful AGI could be taken in that direction), but rather something that can be applied to a wide variety of problems. For example: playing chess and poker, picking stocks, solving puzzles, proving math theorems, analyzing and writing computer code, speech and image recognition, improve itself by learning and self modification, etc.<br /><br /><br />There is an alluring approach to AGI, where you begin with a "simple" seed program, which will learn and self improve and eventually evolve to human intelligence and beyond. I think that in practice, the problem is that it has taken lots of people lots of time to invent all those algorithms that can be useful in general problem solving.&nbsp;Humans are pretty good at general problem solving - certainly much better than the best software/hardware combination we have today. Constructing algorithms to solve specific problems is in itself a kind of problem solving, and we humans have certainly invented many different algorithms for a wide variety of purposes. One might suspect that&nbsp;the computational depth of inventing/discovering algorithms is very large.&nbsp;So unless the seed program is actually very advanced, more like a full grown Sequoia than a seed, it might take too much time for it to invent all those algorithms and heuristics that we, as a civilization, already have.<br /><br /><br />Topics that are potentially useful to understand include:<br /><br /><br /><ul><li>Statistics (Bayes rule, distributions, Markov chains, running an experiment, etc).</li><li>Algorithms for optimizing parameters (genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, steepest descent, linear programming, random testing and purely analytical methods). In some situations it could take days or more to try a single parameter configuration. In other situations evaluating the fitness of a parameter configuration is just a couple of CPU instructions. Approaching these different tasks require a variety of methods</li><li>Logic</li><li>Basic mathematics (calculus, algebra, geometry, etc)</li><li>Code analysis (lambda calculus, etc)</li><li>Formal proof methods (knowledge of the methods listed here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_proof) and formal reasoning</li><li>Tree and graph searching (depth-first, breadth-first, A*, beam, minimax, alpha-beta, Dijkstra)</li><li>Bayesian belief networks</li><li>Pattern recognition</li><li>Compression</li><li>Monte Carlo method</li><li>Clustering and classification</li><li>Fourier transforms, wavelets</li><li>Function approximation (analytical or with neural networks or genetic programming)</li><li>Inverting functions (in other words, given a program function and its output tell me what the input was - this turn out to be a very general way of posing questions)</li></ul><br /><div>...and of course many more.</div><div><br /></div><div>I consider statistics and parameter optimization to be the most important areas for intelligence, since you need them to learn. Pattern recognition (perhaps implemented with statistics and optimization) and various forms of tree searching are also vital.</div><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">An encyclopedia of algorithms</span><br /><br />My approach is based on implementing an encyclopedia of useful algorithms that:<br /><br /><ol><li>Know to which tasks they can be applied</li><li>Can give a rough, initially often ridiculously rough, estimate of what the probability is that they solve the task after a certain time or, in the case of an open-ended task such as optimization, can give a rough estimate of how well the task is solved after a certain time.</li><li>Can continuously update the estimate as the task is solved</li></ol><br />It is important to stress that it is not enough to just implement a library of algorithms that can work on the same datastructures. The important thing is that you need metadata, describing when an algorithm can be used and the algorithmic complexity in time and memory. With time, you want to automatically build up more knowledge of the algorithms, gradually improving the time and success estimations as well as improving your knowledge of which algorithms are suitable in which situations.<br /><br />The algorithms should be broken up into as many natural subtasks as possible, so that when new algorithms are added to the system, they can try to solve these subtasks as well, thus creating new hybrid algorithms.<br /><br />A <i>task</i> is basically a function call together with its arguments. An algorithm that can solve a task implements the corresponding function and a time/success estimator. Similarly to function overloading in C++, the function header might state specializations, additional properties, of the function arguments that must be true for the algorithm to be a contender to solve it. It is important that the <i>Scheduler</i> (see below) immediately knows which algorithms are suitable for a certain task, so the mentioned "additional argument properties" must be immediately available. If a certain property requires work to find out - "is the list in the first argument sorted?" - and an algorithm still needs it, a new algorithm can be constructed that first checks if the list is sorted and then either fails or asks the task again with the new property set. This new algorithm would have higher estimates of running time and lower estimates of success than the original algorithm.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">The Scheduler</span><br /><br />When a task is added to the task pool it always has a <i>price</i> attached to it. The Scheduler runs those algorithms that currently promise best expected price per time unit. Algorithms that need subtasks solved has to assign a price to those too, before adding them to the task pool. That price should reasonably reflect how much of the overall time the subtask is expected to take. If it turns out that a subtask consistently take a smaller or larger fraction of the estimated total time, there should be algorithms that modify the price for these subtasks and correspondingly the total time estimate (also, see <i>Self Improvement</i> below).<br /><br />Open-ended tasks where something should be optimized cannot have just one value attached to them. Instead they need to have a function from achieved performance to price, or at least a rough mapping from some performance values to price. This mapping stops the system from optimizing for too long on a relatively unimportant subsubsubtask somewhere.<br /><br />Algorithms that can either fail or succeed on a task need a similar mapping, where they give probability of success as a function of time.<br /><br />One can also imagine that the algorithms could give a confidence interval or standard deviation on their estimates to tell the Scheduler how sure they are of their estimates, but I am not quite sure how this should be used, so for now they won't.<br /><br />For my first try, the Scheduler will use a simple heuristic. The algorithm that claims to have the best price / time ratio for any task currently in the task pool will get to run it. For one thread this will be optimal in some sense. It gets more complex when you have many algorithms running in parallel on multiple cores or even clusters. For example, you want to slightly punish two algorithms trying to complete the same task in parallel, since the first one to succeed will always make the other algorithms work moot. On the other hand sometimes it makes sense to attack an important problem from several angles, so you don't want to forbid it entirely either.<br /><br />In a later design, the Scheduler should be able to use the task pool to think about how it should Schedule. Obviously this must not end in an infinite Scheduling loop or general inefficiency, since normally the Scheduler must work very quickly.<br /><br />The Scheduler's work and indeed that of the whole system will not be especially interesting when there are only a few algorithms implemented. The first interesting moment will be when new hybrid algorithms emerge, where subtasks are sometimes handled by unanticipated algorithms. I am not sure how many algorithms needs to be implemented for the system to show interesting emergent behaviour. Probably more than ten, but less than a hundred, depending, of course, on which algorithms and what you count as an individual algorithm.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Self improvement</span><br /><br />From the above, you can see that the system will not be self improving at first. However, by adding self improvement tasks, it will start doing things like improving the time estimates of the algorithms, learn to what degree one algorithm's failure to solve a task should also reflect on the estimates of other algorithms, learn which situations are suitable for which algorithms; for example which algorithms perform well on the subtasks posted from a certain algorithm. It can also have an algorithm that constructs new lower-priced training tasks from real tasks, for example generalizations or specializations of a problem, just out of "curiosity".<br /><br />Producing new/improved code and algorithms, either for self improvement or as the solution for a puzzle or some other task, is among the most advanced tasks the system can try. It will not be able to do much of interest in this area until it is really strong, but it could start out by trying simple modifications of existing algorithms or trying them on similar tasks, a bit like in genetic programming.<br /><br />The system is also inherently self improving from a sort of network effect, since for each algorithm added, the existing algorithms get potentially better.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">What now?</span><br /><br />When I have implemented the base system, I will start by applying the AGI to function inversion. Trivial stuff at first, of course, but I hope to eventually make it solve real puzzles like Towers of Hanoi by a combination of searching and deduction. Also, it would be fun to try some games and an NP-complete problem like 3-SAT.<br /><i><br /></i><br />It would be beautiful if the algorithms were written in the same simplified, purely functional (thus easier to analyze), LISP that I plan to write the problem definitions in. Alas, good AI needs to be fast and a 100x slower system just because the algorithms run in my own immature poorly interpreted language instead of C is not so fun. However, a good JIT compiler is a very good test for an AGI. You continuously have to weigh optimization time against running what you have. If the AGI in some distant future JITs its own code, effectively running and optimizing itself, I will consider the entire project a grand success :).<br /><br />I forget why I called the project Guerilla. It was probably terribly clever. Nevertheless, here is the link to the Github repository:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/gurgeh/Guerilla">https://github.com/gurgeh/Guerilla</a>. It does not contain much yet.<br />  <div class="zemanta-pixie" style="height: 15px; margin-top: 10px;"></div></div>

@acetoline No, the project is not abandoned, but thanks for asking :). I tend to post infrequent, overambitiously long posts, so a few weeks silence is normal.<br /><br />The reason the github activity is low is more silly. I am currently in something between the design and implementation stage, writing Python code with a few pseudocode elements and a lot of prose. For some reason, I have not considered this semi-code &quot;commit-worthy&quot;.<br /><br />I promise a github update this week.</div>

Doesn&#39;t sound like a well scalable solution. Don&#39;t get overexcited/misled after some early luck in well defined toy worlds. With teaching by manual algorithm entry by techies, you aren&#39;t gonna get very far.</div>

Hopefully, yes, it should be able to solve general problems using more specialized algorithms working together. It will not, however, take a set of specialized algorithms (let&#39;s say playing chess, checkers, poker and backgammon) and produce a general game playing algorithm. That is not how it achieves generality.<br /><br />It is geared towards very technical users. It takes input tasks as snippets of code and gives a  set of inputs that makes the function output true. This is called function inversion and is a fairly simple way of describing puzzles and technical problems.<br /><br />If it turns out to be a useful system for solving these types of tasks (a big IF - no one has really been able to achieve that). It would be a very good base on which to build something that can communicate with non-technical users and interact with our fuzzy world. That is not it&#39;s primary purpose, though.</div>

Can this &#39;AGI&#39; generate general algorithms from a set of relevant non-general algorithms? Will non-technical users be able to teach this AI by describing specific (/non-general) scenarios?</div>

@Jiri Swedes, Norwegians, Danes and many Finns can read Swedish. That makes up a good 0.3% of the earth population :).<br /><br />Actually, I will remove that. That source code is not for human consumption yet. It is just test cases for analyzing source code, written in an odd Lisp dialect. No actual code relating to implementing either any of the algorithms I write about or the Scheduler.</div>

Compression is one of the most powerful concepts in computing. For the normal computer user, compression is associated with making files smaller, so you can store more of them or send them faster over the Internet, but there is much more to it.<br /><br />An optimal compressor can (or could, if it existed) be used for prediction of the future of a sequence of events (weather, sports, stocks, political events, etc), for example by trying all possible continuations and examine how well it compresses given the history. Conversely, an optimal predictor that gives the correct probability of each possible next symbol can be used for optimal compression by using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arithmetic_coding">arithmetic coding</a>.<br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><br /></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Compression and prediction</span><br /><br /><i>This section on background theory contains possibly scary math and dense prose, but should be understandable for most programmers. Maybe re-read the sentences a couple of times.</i><br /><br />Ray Solomonoff has shown&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theworld.com/~rjs/chris1.pdf">[PDF]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;that if we let Sk be the infinite set of all programs for a machine M, such that M(Sk) gives an output with X as prefix (i.e the first bits of the output is X), then the probability of X becomes the sum of the probabilities of all of its programs, where the probability of a program is&nbsp;2 ** (-|Sk|) if |Sk| is the length of the program in bits and "**" means "to the power of". As X gets longer, the error of the predictions approach zero, if the error is calculated as the total squared probability difference.<br /><br />A technicality is that only those programs count, that does not still produce X, when the last bit of the program is removed.<br /><br />To give a slightly more concrete example, say that you have a sequence of events - a history - and encode those as a sequence of symbols, X. Let us further say that you have a machine, M, that can read a program S and output a sequence of symbols. If you have no further information on your sequence of events, then the best estimate for the probability of a symbol Z to occur next (i.e the best prediction) is given by the set of all programs that output your history X followed by Z. Programs which output X+Z and are short are weighted higher (the 2 ** (-|Sk|) part).<br /><br /><br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Even more concretely, given the binary sequence 101010101, you wonder what the probability is that the next bit will be 0 given that you know nothing else of this sequence. Sum 2 ** (-program length) for all programs that output 1010101010 vs those that output 1010101011 as their first bits (they are allowed to continue outputting stuff). If we call these sums sum0 and sum1 respectively, then the probability of 0 coming next is sum0 / (sum0 + sum1) and the probability of 1 coming next is sum1 / (sum0 + sum1).</div><br /><br />Obviously you cannot find all these programs by just trying every possible program, because 1) they are infinitely many and 2) given <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">the halting problem</a> you cannot in general know if a running program is in an infinite loop or if it will eventually output X.<br /><br />There is an area of probability theory called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_description_length">Minimum description length</a>, where the language is chosen to be so simple (not Turing complete) so that you can actually find the shortest program or "description". Calculating probabilities this way is very similar to Bayesian probability, but more general.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Solomonoff in (almost) practice</span><br /><br />Although the point of the theorem is not to apply it directly in practice, for short sequences X we can actually try. We can avoid problem 1 above, there are infinitely many programs, by generating random programs and see if they produce X. If they do, we count them. This way we can produce an approximation of what the true sum0 and sum1 are. If we set up our random generation such that shorter programs are more likely, then we don't have to bother with the 2 ** (-program length) part and may just have a running count for each sum. If the sequence is too long, this method will be impractical since almost no randomly generated programs will actually output X.<br /><br />Problem 2 above, when we test programs they may not halt, is harder, but Levin has proposed a way around it. If we in addition to program length use running time (number of instructions executed) as a measure of the probability of our program, we can start by generating all the programs that we intend to test and then run them all in parallel. As our execution moves forward, we will get an increasingly accurate approximation of the true sum0 and sum1, without getting stuck on infinite loops.<br /><br />If we want to get even more practical, it can be shown that the shortest program that produces X will generally dominate the others and thus it will predict the most likely next symbol. That way you can just search for programs that output X and the currently shortest program will be your best guess. Since we no longer care about the relative probability of the next symbol, but only which is most likely, the search does not have to be random. Thus we can use any method we like for finding a short program. If you search for programs that produce X and find one that almost does, you can construct a "true" solution from that one, by constructing a prefix part that hard codes the places where your original program is wrong. This will produce a longer program, where the length, and thus the "score", is the length of the prefix + the length of your faulty solution. The size of the shortest program that outputs X is called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity">Kolmogorov complexity</a> of X. The size of the shortest program that outputs X, measured in program size + log(running time), is called the <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Algorithmic_complexity">Levin complexity</a> of X.<br /><br />One way to find these programs is to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_programming">genetic programming</a>, just take care that you don't think that you can count the number of programs that produce X and get relative probabilities, because your search will now be skewed towards the solution (and thus its prediction) that you find first.<br /><br />A small problem is that depending on what machine you choose, i.e which instructions your programs can use and the length of these instructions, you will get different results. The method has a built in bias, since there is no one correct Turing complete language. This difference will however be smaller as X gets longer. One way to understand that is to note that any Turing complete language can emulate any other Turing complete language and that the size of such an emulator is finite. This is called the compiler theorem.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Compression is understanding and the Hutter Prize</span><br /><br />When we understand something, we can describe it succinctly. If I have an image of a red perfect circle, the size will be much larger if I describe the individual pixels rather than just say "a red circle of diameter d and thickness t". When I understand what the image is depicting, I can describe it shorter. Sometimes a lossy compression of observed data will actually express the truth better than the exact data. If I take a photo of a red circle, the photo will probably not be perfect, but if I notice what the photo is showing, I can compress it as "a red circle" and some noise which I throw away, and suddenly my lossy compression is a better depiction of the truth.<br /><br />This equivalence between compression and general intelligence led Marcus Hutter to announce the <a href="http://prize.hutter1.net/">Hutter Prize</a>, where money is awarded for the best compression of 100 megabyte of English Wikipedia articles. So far the compression algorithms have been impressive (compressing the text to about 15%), but not shown much intelligence or understanding of the articles. When they do start to exhibit some understanding, I think that if they are allowed to compress the data in a slightly lossy way, the first thing that will happen is that some spelling and layout mistakes will be corrected, because these will be surprising to the compressor and thus demand an unusually long representation.<br /><br />Matt Mahoney has written a good rationale on the Hutter Prize <a href="http://cs.fit.edu/~mmahoney/compression/rationale.html">here</a>.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;">Compression in practice - the juicy stuff</span><br /><br />Compression is a powerful tool to measure success and avoid overfitting in a variety of common AI problems. The methods I laid out here are interesting mostly from a theoretical perspective, because of their prohibitively long running times.&nbsp;In my next post, I will expand on my thoughts on how you can use these results to get actual, practical algorithms for common AI problems.<br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></div>

    <updated>2010-05-05T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://gurgeh.github.com/blog/2010/05/05/solving-sudoku-with-genetic-algorithms</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
I recently wrote a small Python library for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm">genetic algorithms</a> (GA), called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/optopus">optopus</a>. One thing I tried when I played around with it was to solve a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku">Sudoku</a> puzzle. There are plenty of efficient ways to solve Sudoku, but with my shiny new hammer, all problems look like nails.<br /><br />Also, I remember that I once read something from someone who tried a GA C-library on Sudoku and concluded that it was not a suitable problem. If I could solve it with my slick library, that random person on the internet, whose web page I might never find again but who may exist as far as you know, would certainly be proven wrong. A worthy cause.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">Genetic algorithms</span><br />A genetic algorithm is a general way to solve optimization problems. The basic algorithm is very simple:<br /><ol><li>Create a population (vector) of random solutions (represented in a problem specific way, but often a vector of floats or ints)</li><li>Pick a few solutions and sort them according to fitness</li><li>Replace the worst solution with a new solution, which is either&nbsp;a copy of the best solution, a mutation (perturbation) of the best&nbsp;solution, an entirely new randomized solution or a cross between the two&nbsp;best solutions. These are the most common evolutionary operators, but you could dream up others that use information from existing solutions to create new potentially good solutions.</li><li>Check if you have a new global best fitness, if so, store the solution.</li><li>If too many iterations go by without improvement, the entire population&nbsp;might be stuck in a local minimum (at the bottom of a local valley, with a possible chasm&nbsp;somewhere else, so to speak). If so, kill everyone and start over at 1.</li><li>Go to 2.</li></ol>Fitness is a measure of how good a solution is, lower meaning better. This measure is performed by a fitness function that you supply. Writing a fitness function is how you describe the problem to the GA. The magnitude of the fitness values returned does not matter (in sane implementations), only how they compare to each other.<br /><br />There are other, subtly different, ways to perform the evolutionary process. Some are good and some are popular but bad. The one described above is called tournament selection and it is one of the good ways. Much can be said about the intricacies of GA but it will have to be said somewhere else, lest I digress completely.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">Optopus and Sudoku</span><br />Using optopus is easy:<br /><br /><pre class="brush: python">from optopus import ga, stdgenomes<br /><br />#Now we choose a representation. We know that the answer to the puzzle must be some permutation of the digits 1 to 9, each used nine times.<br /><br />init_vect = sum([range(1,10)] * 9, []) # A vector of 81 elements<br />genome = stdgenomes.PermutateGenome (init_vect)<br /><br />#I made a few functions to calculate how many conflicts a potential Sudoku solution has. I'll show them later, but for now let us just import the package. I also found a puzzle somewhere and put it in the PUZZLE constant.<br /><br />import sudoku<br />solver = ga.GA(sudoku.ga_sudoku(sudoku.PUZZLE) , genome)<br /><br />#And now, when we have supplied the GA with a fitness function (ga_sudoku, which counts Sudoku conflicts) and a representation (genome), let us just let the solver do its magic.<br /><br />solver.evolve(target_fitness=0)<br /></pre><br />And in a few minutes (about 2.6 million iterations when I tried) the correct answer pops out!<br /><br />The nice thing about this method is that you do not have to know anything about how to solve a Sudoku puzzle or even think very hard at all. Note that I did not even bother to just let it search for the unknown values - it also has to find the digits that we already know (which should not be too hard with a decent fitness function, see below). The only bit of thinking we did was to understand that a Sudoku solution has to be a permutation of&nbsp;<i>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]</i>, but this merely made the evolution part faster. If we wanted to make it faster still, we could make a genome type that let us say that there are actually nine separate vectors who are each guaranteed to be a permutation of 1 to 9. We could have thought even less and represented the solution by 81 ints who are all in the range 1 to 9, by using another genome type:<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">&gt;&gt; genome = stdgenomes.EnumGenome(81, range(1,10))</span></span><br /><br />The range argument to EnumGenome does not have to be a vector of integers, it could be a vector of any objects, since they are never treated like numbers.<br /><br />In my experiment this took maybe 15 - 30 minutes to solve. For more difficult Sudoku puzzles, I would definitely go with the permutation genome, since using EnumGenome increases the search space to 9^81 or <i>196627050475552913618075908526912116283103450944214766927315415537966391196809</i> possible solutions.<br /><br />FYI, this is the puzzle in sudoku.PUZZLE:<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;4|8 &nbsp;| 17</b></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"><b>67 |9 &nbsp;| &nbsp;&nbsp;</b></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"><b>5 8| 3 | &nbsp;4</b></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"><b>-----------</b></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"><b>3 &nbsp;|74 |1 &nbsp;</b></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"><b>&nbsp;69| &nbsp; |78&nbsp;</b></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;1| 69| &nbsp;5</b></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"><b>-----------</b></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"><b>1 &nbsp;| 8 |3 6</b></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;6| 91</b></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"><b>24 | &nbsp;1|5 &nbsp;</b></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"><br /></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">I think a Sudoku puzzle that is harder for humans would not be that much harder for optopus to solve, but I have not tested it.</span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"><br /></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">Sudoku fitness function</span></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">OK, so that was a ridiculously easy way to solve a Sudoku puzzle, but I skipped one part that is crucial to all GA - describing the problem using a fitness function.

@blob Unfortunately I have no variable length genomes in optopus, but it is easy enough to create one yourself. Look at BaseGenome and perhaps take some inspiration from FloatGenome.</div>

I coded a Java GA for solving sudoku this year in a Meta-Heuristics course I took post grad. The best solving time I obtained from a few runs of AL Escargot was 9 minutes 41 seconds on a 2.66ghz core2 workstation, other problems took from sub one to 40 odd seconds depending on the difficulty. In the end the GA used four different methods of applying selection pressure, 4 more methods to then pare up parents, six different crossover methods, a modified island model and population restarting conditions... Needless to say comparitively to other meta-heuristics it is a very inefficient method.</div>

Human puzzle solvers and computers use very different approaches for Sudoku.  Humans are good at finding patterns.  Computers use brute force with genetic algorithms or other forms of recursive backtracking.  Take a look at:<br />   http://www.mathworks.com/moler/exm/chapters/sudoku.pdf</div>

So there is a GA to solve Sudoku.  That means there must be a constructive algorithm to solve it too.<br />What is the constructive algorithm?</div>

Pretty cool, so did it solve one sudoku puzzle or did it evolve an algorithm to solve sudoku puzzles in general?<br /><br />Thanks for posting it!</div>

Very interesting way to solve sudoku.<br /><br />I am just curious, exactly how long did it take for you to solve Sudoku? <br />I have a solution that solves Sudoku (among other tougher problems) very fast. <br />I just want to know your number before telling(bragging, as some might say) about mine.<br /><br />I just wanna compare the speed of the two solutions, yours and mine.<br />Really good post.</div>

Seems like genetic algorithms for sudoku solutions are a decent example of GA.  But I think it might be fun/interesting to use GA to build some sort of logic engine to solve sudokus.  :)</div>

<div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Remember the classification problem from <a href="http://fakeguido.blogspot.com/2010/04/confident-optimization-using-gates.html">part 1</a>? I wrote a small script to simulate solutions with different success rates.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">For our first investigation, let us say that we have created 600 solutions. 400 of them have a true fitness 0.5 (a 50% chance to answer correctly - no better than random since our test cases are 50/50 positive and negative) and 200 of them have found something and have a true fitness of 0.6. One limitation to these simulations is that we assume that two different solutions with a fitness of 0.6 are totally uncorrelated on the tests, while in reality the solutions might very well have picked up on the same pattern and be completely correlated.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">In our hypothetical situation we have 300 different test cases that are out of sample, i.e not used by the process that created the solutions.300 test cases might seem like very few, but the circumstances are favorable. The 50/50 split between positive and negative helps. If it was just one positive in a hundred, many more cases would be needed. If the test cases are weighted, with some more important than others to get right, you also need more test cases.</div><div><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Running the 600 solutions through the 300 test cases, we might get the following histogram with 15 bins:</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-8MSZS6yWdk/S9VX31h9Q7I/AAAAAAAAAEA/6fYx09jTTRw/s1600/Gate+histogram+for+peaks.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="482" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-8MSZS6yWdk/S9VX31h9Q7I/AAAAAAAAAEA/6fYx09jTTRw/s640/Gate+histogram+for+peaks.png" width="640" /></a></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">If we could measure the fitness exactly, we would just see two bars - one at 0.5 and one at 0.6. Based on this graph, can we take the best solution and ask what is the probability that it is better than 0.55? 0.58? 0.62? It is hard to know. It really looks like there ought to be some solution better than 0.6.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">I divided the 300 tests into three gates with 100 in each. In some of my tests, no solution made it through all the gates, suggesting that I either needed more tests or more solutions, so just to test the theory I increased the number of 0.5-solutions to 100 000 and 0.6 to 50 000.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Running the solutions through the gates with a cutoff of 0.55 (meaning that we search for solutions that have a true fitness of 0.55 or better and only let those through that have a measured fitness of 0.55 on each gate) yielded the following result:</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><i>C0 = 150000</i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><i>C1 = 54774 (C0 / C1 = 2.74)</i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><i>C2 = 35543 (C1 / C2 = 1.54)</i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><i>C2 = 27891 (C2 / C3 = 1.27)</i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">The ratios are decreasing nicely, as expected. I solved the equations in part 1 numerically, using my genetic algorithm library,&nbsp;<a href="http://code.google.com/p/optopus">optopus</a>, for Python, thus ending up with the following:</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><i>0.34 good solutions, with 0.82 passing through each gate</i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><i>0.66 bad solutions, with 0.14 passing through each gate</i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">This means that the predicted probability of drawing a good solution after each gate is:</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><i>0.34 (before any gate. True value is approx. 0.33)</i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><i>0.75 (after one gate.

This violates the assumption in part 1, that we have at least one good solution.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">With cutoff 0.62, I got this:</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><i>C0 = 150000</i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><i>C1 = 16043 (C0 / C1 = 9.35)</i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><i>C2 = 4733 (C1 / C2 = 3.39)</i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><i>C3 = 1400 (C2 / C1 = 3.38)</i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Here something worrisome happens. The ratio stops decreasing. Since this ratio is supposed to asymptotically reach the inverse of Pg, the probability that a good solution pass the gate, this should trigger an alarm. If we say that the fitness of a good solution has to be better than or equal to 0.62 and have a cutoff of 0.62 in the gates, how can only one in 3.38 pass? We should always get at least half of the good solutions through.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Running the GA gives:</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><i>0.35 good, with a 0.3 probability to pass</i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><i>0.65 bad with a 0.0004 probability to pass</i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Which is completely wrong, since there are only bad solutions if we try to find solutions that are 0.62 or better. Remember that all our solutions have a true fitness of 0.5 or 0.6. We again get a stern warning that something is wrong, since a 0.3 probability to pass is too low. We expect at least half of the good solutions to pass. More than half should pass if the solutions are noticeably above the cutoff value, but anything under 0.5 means we are in trouble.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Taking that warning into account, it would seem that the gate test worked here as well.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">The problem</span></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Does it always work? Sadly, no. As I hinted in my last post, there is a problem. Let us say that instead of two kinds of solutions, 0.5 and 0.6, we have 100 solutions distributed evenly between 0.3 and 0.7. Just sending this solution distribution through the 300 tests yields (15 bins):</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-8MSZS6yWdk/S9VX8HlcdWI/AAAAAAAAAEI/pcuKNok-R6s/s1600/Gate+histogram+for+even+dist.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="482" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-8MSZS6yWdk/S9VX8HlcdWI/AAAAAAAAAEI/pcuKNok-R6s/s640/Gate+histogram+for+even+dist.png" width="640" /></a></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">The distribution does not look very uniform anymore, but at least it looks like we have nothing over 0.7, which is true.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">With cutoff 0.65, we get:</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><i>C0 = 40000</i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><i>C1 = 4656 (C0 / C1 = 8.59)</i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><i>C2 = 2385 (C1 / C2 = 1.95)</i></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><i>C3 = 1392 (C2 / C1 = 1.71)</i></div><div><br /></div><div>Everything looks all right.

This happens because one of our initial assumptions, that there are only either good or bad solutions, is wrong. Since the C-ratios decrease, it looks like we get progressively more and more good solutions, which we are, but at a smaller rate than indicated. What happens is that the better a solution is, the more likely it is to survive, so the gates make sure that the better of the bad solutions survive, which makes a larger ratio of the entire "population" of solutions survive each time.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Note that the answer will not always be overestimated. If the even distribution is located mainly to the right of the cutoff, I think that the answer will instead be underestimated, but I have not yet tested this. It might be worth mentioning that running with cutoff 0.72 yielded very bad C-ratios, so that still works as before.</div><br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">Gates as transfer functions</span></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">A series of test cases and a cutoff value can be seen as a transfer function on the distribution of solutions. When the solutions are run through a gate, the transfer function is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolve">convolved</a>&nbsp;with the solution distribution to yield a new solution distribution. In the graph below, I have plotted the transfer functions for five different gates, with the same cutoff but with different number of test cases. Once again we have relatively few test cases, but just as we discussed earlier, if the test cases are not divided 50/50 between positive and negative or there are weights, we need many more to get the same gate characteristics.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-8MSZS6yWdk/S9WV3GVHcHI/AAAAAAAAAEg/aJI4ZFzcr7c/s1600/Gate+Transfer+Functions+70.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="482" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-8MSZS6yWdk/S9WV3GVHcHI/AAAAAAAAAEg/aJI4ZFzcr7c/s640/Gate+Transfer+Functions+70.png" width="640" /></a></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">The more test cases that the gate has, the steeper the transfer function. It will look more and more like a step function as the gate gets "larger". In the limit that is actually is a step function (with infinitely many test cases), our earlier assumption fully holds and the predictions would again be correct. These transfer functions will move the solution distribution to the right (better true fitness). The only thing we can measure is still C, the number of solutions left, which in the continuous case would be the integral of the solution distribution.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">Possible solutions</span></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">If we knew the shape of our initial solution distribution and the shape of the transfer function, we would once again be in business and be able to predict the number of solutions above a cutoff correctly. The transfer function can be estimated, but the solution distribution can vary greatly. Maybe all solutions have the same true fitness? Maybe they are divided into two "pillars" as in the example above? Maybe they are spread in some more complex shape across the spectrum?</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Instead of just finding out the value of two points of the solution distribution (good and bad), we would get better estimates if we could get the value of more points. But knowledge of more variables require more equations. Where will these equations come from? We have two sources of untapped information.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">First of all, we have not used the exact result when the solutions are run against the test, only if they pass the cutoff or not. By letting the cutoff move from 0 to 1 and running the same gates over and over again, we can gain additional information on the shape of the solution distribution. If the transfer functions where linear, we would not gain additional information from this, but since they are not, the different resulting integrals can tell us something.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-8MSZS6yWdk/S9VX_cQzHlI/AAAAAAAAAEY/AJtkYerEHtc/s1600/Gate+Transfer+Functions+with+9+Test+Cases.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="482" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-8MSZS6yWdk/S9VX_cQzHlI/AAAAAAAAAEY/AJtkYerEHtc/s640/Gate+Transfer+Functions+with+9+Test+Cases.png" width="640" /></a></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">The results of the different cutoffs are of course not totally independent, so each new cutoff will not magically bring about a new independent equation, but it will still improve our understanding of the shape of the solution distribution.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">The other source of information that we have not used is that not all solutions run against all test cases, since we filter out so many after each gate. This means that there are tests (thus information) that are not being used. The easiest way to use this information is to do as suggested in <a href="http://fakeguido.blogspot.com/2010/04/confident-optimization-using-gates.html">part 1</a>&nbsp;and rerun the gate experiment with the gates in different order. This will not give more equations, but will increase the accuracy of the measured Cs which in turn may allow more gates with fewer tests in each, which gives more equations.</div><br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">This is my main approach and the one that I will test in practice and write my next post about.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">I have, however, two other rough ideas that one could pursue.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">One approach is to abandon gates and look at the measured fitness histogram for all test cases (like the two I have shown above) and try to run it in reverse, by generating hypothetical true distributions and see how likely they are to end up in the measured distribution after the blurring effect of the test process. Maybe image deblurring techniques such as Gaussian&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_reduction">noise reduction</a>&nbsp;can be used?</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">The other approach is to study&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deconvolution">deconvolution</a>&nbsp;- the process of running a convolution in reverse. According to the Wikipedia article, deconvolution is often associated with image processing, where it is used to reverse optical distortion. Maybe this method will actually converge with the deblurring approach?</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div></div>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
When dealing with any non-linear optimization or classification algorithm, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithms">Genetic Algorithms</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network">Artifical Neural Networks</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing">Simulated Annealing</a>, you need a way to compute the fitness of your candidate solutions. These algorithms all work in roughly the same way - you generate a solution, test it and generate new solutions based on feedback from the testing (the feedback will usually just consist of a fitness value).<br /><br />For some problems you can get the <i>true fitness</i> of a solution. If you, for example, are maximizing a known mathematical function of many variables, you immediately know exactly how good your solution is. However, for most interesting problems you will never know the true fitness. If you are evolving parameters for a poker playing program, a stock predictor or a walrus image classifier, you never know quite how good your solution is in general. The best you can do is try your solution on a number of test cases and assume that your average performance on those tests are the same as your average performance when the number of test cases approach infinity.<br /><br />An optimization algorithm will often become over-specialized in the test cases that it is trained on. To combat this, a method called "holdout validation" is often used. The data is divided up into several disjunct sets - a training set used for fitness calculation of the millions or billions of proposed solutions, a validation set for validating the fitness of solutions that are candidates of being the most promising so far and a test set for testing the final solution of your run. Often you will make several runs of your optimization algorithm with different types of inputs and parameters. The test set is used to decide which of the runs produced the best solution.<br /><br />This standard approach will sometimes work, but there are problems. If your fitness function is very volatile and test cases are hard to come by, you can never be quite sure how consistent your solution is. What is the chance that a solution will happen to get lucky on all three sets of test cases? Low? If I am persistent and keep running the same optimization problem on my computer cluster with the inputs prepared differently and different parameters until I get something that finally pass my tests, what are the risk that after billions and billions of tries, I have just found a fluke that will not perform well on further data? Obviously one can never be completely sure, but <b>it would be nice to at least know what the probability is that we have found a real solution</b>.<br /><br />One possibly more effective way of using your data is to employ&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)">cross validation</a>, but if you test several solutions, the problems with "luck" will reappear.<br /><br />I'd like to explore a different theory that I have been tinkering with.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">Gates - an introduction</span><br /><br />In this introduction, I will make a number of simplifications, assumptions and ungodly approximations. I hope to remedy this in the next post.<br /><br />Let us take the problem of walrus image recognition from the introduction. Imagine that we have a number of subaquatic images. Half of them depict sea weed, lobsters and whatnot and half are of walruses. A good walrus classifier will identify over 70% of the images correctly.<br /><br />Let us further make the assumption that a walrus classifier is either good or bad, with nothing in between. This assumption can not be entirely true, since an optimization algorithm needs a way to arrive at its solution through gradual improvement, which means that there must be somewhat good solutions. Nevertheless, it will have to do as an approximation for now.<br /><br />Assume we have a black-box algorithm that spits solutions at us. We will call the number of good solutions at a certain time <i>Sg</i> and the number of bad solutions <i>Sb</i>. The total number of solutions, <i>C0</i>, is just C0 = Sg + Sb.<br /><br />Take the images that the algorithm did not get to see and divide them randomly into three equally large sets. Each set is now a <i>Gate</i>, which will let through only those solutions that can correctly classify above 70% (it does not have to be the same as our target percentage) of the images in the set. We can assume that it is approximately equally hard to get through any gate. This assumption can be tested by simply sending our solutions through each gate and check that roughly the same number of solutions pass.<br /><br />Unfortunately there is a chance that a bad solution could get lucky and pass the gate (a false positive) or that a good solution could get unlucky and fail (a false negative), but for a meaningful test, a good solution must always have a better chance to pass the gate than a bad solution.<br /><br />Let us define the probability that a good solution passes a gate as <i>Pg</i> and the probability that a bad solution passes as <i>Pb</i>. As the number of test cases in each gate approaches infinity, Pg will approach 1 and Pb will approach 0.<br /><br />If we set up an experiment where we first send our solutions through the first gate, then send the survivors through the second and finally those survivors through the third gate, we can measure the remaining population size at four points. After the black box: C0, after the first gate: C1, second gate: C2 and third gate C3.<br /><br />If our gates are testing anything relevant and our population consists of both good and bad solutions (Sg != 0 and Sb != 0) we can immediately see that the ratio between successive gates should decrease C0/C1 &gt; C1/C2 &gt; C2/C3, because there will be a greater ratio of good solutions to bad solutions after each gate and Pg &gt; Pb. In plain English - a smaller percentage of the solutions should disappear each time, as the population gradually contains more good solutions. If this does not hold, we must either have bad gates (too few test cases or something) or no good solutions or no bad solutions. As the ratio of bad to good solutions decrease, C(i) / C(i+1) will approach Pg as most solutions will be good.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">Fortuitous results</span><br /><br />The number of good solutions that remain after the first gate is Sg * Pg and the number of bad is Sb * Pb. Thus we get four equations:<br /><br />C0 = Sg + Sb<br />C1 = Sg * Pg + Sb * Pb<br />C2 = Sg * Pg<sup>2</sup> + Sb * Pb<sup>2</sup><br />C3 = Sg * Pg<sup>3</sup> + Sb * Pb<sup>3</sup><br /><sup><br /></sup><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><sup><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-8MSZS6yWdk/S8XNQldi6DI/AAAAAAAAADw/DABY2O4j6lc/s1600/SimplifiedGates.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-8MSZS6yWdk/S8XNQldi6DI/AAAAAAAAADw/DABY2O4j6lc/s320/SimplifiedGates.png" /></a></span></sup></div><br />Since we have four equations and four unknowns, Sg, Sb, Pg and Pb, we should be able to solve what the ratio of good to bad solutions is and what the characteristics of the gates are. Subsequently we can tell what the chance is that we pick a good solution if we randomly pick one after a certain number of gates. We can also tell how many solutions we will need to generate on average until we have at least one solution that passes through a certain number of gates.<br /><br />There is nothing magical about three gates. If we use more gates with fewer tests in each (thus making Pg and Pb closer) we will get different characteristics. This will result in more equations and the variables will be overdetermined, but they can still be determined using, for example, a least-squares fitting. Trying different number of gates and different gate sizes can help us find the optimal use of our test cases.<br /><br />It is important that Pg and Pb are roughly the same for each gate, in other words that one gate is not significantly harder or easier to pass through than the others. If the gate sizes are large this is more likely to be true. It is straightforward to test this assumption. You can either:<br /><br /><ul><li>Do the simple test described earlier, making sure that C is roughly the same for each gate.</li><li>Put the gates in different order and re-run the experiment, verifying that the results are the same.</li><li>Run the experiment several times, dividing the test cases into three entirely new gates each time and determine the standard deviation of the calculated parameters.</li></ul><br />If C is not roughly the same for each gate, you need larger gates. Go find more data or use fewer gates, but no fewer than three. That simple. (Almost.. we have not defined exactly how rough "roughly" is)<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">Caveat</span><br />So.. Is everything solved that easily? Can we now go out and confidently optimize the world as the title suggests? No, but I believe this approximation can be of great use as it stands. Earlier we made the assumption that solutions are either good or bad, instead of somewhere in a continuous fitness spectrum. In my next post, I will explain why this makes things a bit more complicated.</div>
