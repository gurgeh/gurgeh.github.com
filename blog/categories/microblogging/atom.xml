Twitter became popular because of its 140 character restriction, orginally designed to fit an SMS.<br /><br />This restriction promises the follower that everything will be easily digested, but perhaps more important is the benefit to the writer.<br /><br />Often someone starts a blog, but then quits when every post becomes too long. Too ambitious. Twitter frees the writer of such pressure.<br /><br />Pressure to be concise is great, but I propose that the 140 char limit is too limiting to express anything interesting. Tweets are dumb.<br /><br />Instead of microblogging, I propose #milliblogging. You must constrict yourself to (maybe?) 1000 characters - the length of 7 tweets.<br /><br />Would you join such a site? Would you rather it be an extended Twitter-client or a new community?<br /><br />#Milliblogging - for people with something to say.<br /><br />(This post was also tweeted by me on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/fnedrik">http://www.twitter.com/fnedrik</a> )</div>

I started out with the target of 5 tweets / 700 characters, but I found out that to express the idea itself, I needed 7 tweets.</div>

Interesting idea. I don&#39;t know. Usually my posts are way long... Maybe I can try to write my next post as 7 tweets to try.<br /><br />Ruben</div>
